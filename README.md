# 🔍 AI-Driven Insights into the Indian Job Market

This project uses **Machine Learning & Data Analysis** to explore and predict trends in Indian job postings, aimed at helping freshers and job seekers make data-informed decisions.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Synthetic Dataset** based on real-world job trends in India  
- Includes: job titles, categories, skills, experience, salary, and locations

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Most common job categories, titles, and cities  
   - In-demand skills across India  
   - Salary distribution patterns  

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Model 1**: Predict job category using job description and skills (Accuracy ~95%)  
   - **Model 2**: Predict whether a job is high-paying or low-paying based on skillset & title (Accuracy ~94%)  

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Top job categories**: Software, Data, Marketing  
- **Top skills**: Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Communication  
- **High-paying jobs** often require modern tech skills like Python, Cloud, ML  
- **Cities with most jobs**: Gurgaon, Chandigarh, Noida, Pune, Bhubaneswar
